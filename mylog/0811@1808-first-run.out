Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step. Paige's team won the game and scored 41 points. We know that Paige scored 11 points. That means that the other players on her team scored 6 points each. So if we add up all the points that the other players scored, we get 6*(the number of other players)=6*x. We also know that the total number of points scored by the team is 41. So we have 11+6x=41. We can solve for x by subtracting 11 from both sides. That gives us 6x=30. Dividing both sides by 6 gives us x=5. So there are 5 other players on Paige's team. The answer is 5.

Q: Chloe was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 6 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's think step by step. Chloe finds 9 points for each treasure. She found 6 treasures on the first level. So, she has 9*6=54 points from the first level. She found 3 treasures on the second level. So, she has 9*3=27 points from the second level. Her total score is 54+27=81. The answer is 81.
pred_before :  Chloe finds 9 points for each treasure. She found 6 treasures on the first level. So, she has 9*6=54 points from the first level. She found 3 treasures on the second level. So, she has 9*3=27 points from the second level. Her total score is 54+27=81. The answer is 81.
