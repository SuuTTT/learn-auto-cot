Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step. The train is currently travelling at 100 miles/hour. It takes 10 hours to reach its destination. This means that the train covers 1,000 miles in 10 hours. After covering quarter of the distance, the train slows down to 75 miles/hour. This means that it will take 1,000 / (4 * 75) = 8 hours to cover the remaining distance. The total journey duration is 10 + 8 = 18 hours. The answer is E.
