Q: There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A:
Let's think step by step. There were 8 friends playing a game. So, they had 8*6=48 lives in total. Then, 2 more players joined the game. So, the total number of lives became 8*6+2*6=60.

Q: For Halloween Katie and her sister combined the candy they received. Katie had 8 pieces of candy while her sister had 23. If they ate 8 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A:
Let's think step by step. Katie and her sister have a total of 8 + 23 = 31 pieces of candy. If they eat 8 pieces the first night, they have 31 - 8 = 23 pieces left.

Q: A pet store had 78 puppies. In one day they sold 30 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A:
Let's think step by step. There are 78 puppies. 30 are sold, so that means there are 48 left. 48 divided by 8 is 6, so that means there are 6 cages with 8 puppies in each.

Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A:
Let's think step by step. Mike made $69 from mowing lawns. He spent $24 on new mower blades. That means he has $45 left. Each game costs $5, so he could buy 9 games.

Cluster  5
Q: Wendy uploaded 45 pictures to Facebook. She put 27 pics into one album and put the rest into 9 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A:
Let's think step by step. First, we know that Wendy uploaded 45 pictures in total. Second, we know that Wendy put 27 pictures into one album. That means that Wendy put the remaining 18 pictures into 9 different albums. That means that each album would have 2 pictures.

Cluster  6
Q: A waiter had 9 tables he was waiting on, with 7 women and 3 men at each table. How many customers total did the waiter have?
A:
Let's think step by step. There are 9 tables. Each table has 7 women and 3 men. That means there are 7 x 9 = 63 women and 3 x 9 = 27 men. Therefore, there are 63 + 27 = 90 customers in total.

Cluster  7
Q: Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A:
Let's think step by step. There are 5 shelves of mystery books. Each shelf has 8 books. So that's 40 mystery books. There are 4 shelves of picture books. Each shelf has 8 books. So that's 32 picture books. 40 + 32 = 72 books.

Cluster  8
Q: A worksheet had 4 problems on it. If a teacher had 9 worksheets to grade and had already graded 5 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?
A:
Let's think step by step. The teacher has already graded 5 worksheets. Each worksheet has 4 problems. So the teacher has graded 5*4=20 problems so far. The teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade. Each worksheet has 4 problems. So the teacher has 9*4=36 problems left to grade. So the teacher has 36-20=16 problems left to grade.
