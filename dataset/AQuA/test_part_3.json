{"question": "Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?", "options": ["A)15", "B)16", "C)17", "D)18", "E)19"], "rationale": "Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.\nAnswer: A", "correct": "A"}
{"question": "John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.\nWhat is the final concentration of tea John drinks?", "options": ["A)15.38%", "B)42%", "C)39.86%", "D)22.35%", "E)32.51%"], "rationale": "Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50% milk tea.\nIn step 1, 15% of the tea is replaced with milk. Thus, 85% of the original tea remains. Since this is done twice, we have a concentration of 50x0.85x0.85% (=36.125%) of tea solution.\nFinally, 10% of this solution is replaced with milk again. So, the final concentration of tea is 36.125*0.9%\nThis equals 32.51% of tea solution.\nAnswer: E", "correct": "E"}
