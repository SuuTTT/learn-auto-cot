{"question": "If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\nI. Q is the square of a prime number.\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers.", "options": ["A)I only", "B)III only", "C)II only", "D)I and II only", "E)I and III only"], "rationale": "If Q has 5 factors, we can represent Q = a^4, where a is positive integer more than 1.Let's assume that \"a\" is not a prime number. Let a = kp, where both k and p are positive integers.\nThus, Q = (kp)4=k4\u2217p4(kp)4=k4\u2217p4. Now the number of factors of Q = (4+1)*(4+1) = 25. But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors, thus \"a\" can't have any other factor except 1 and itself. Thus, a = prime number.\nStatement I :We can represent Q = (a^2)^2. Thus, we have to prove whether a^2 is a prime number. Take a=2. We can see that it is not a prime number. Thus, this option can't answer a \"MUST be true question\"\nStatement II : Always true as proved above.\nStatement III : Again take a =2. Thus, Q = 64. We don't have this as product of 2 primes.\nThe Answer is, B.", "correct": "B"}
