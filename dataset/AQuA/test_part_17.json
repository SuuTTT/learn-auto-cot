(B) doesn\u2019t have to be true \u2013 consider what would happen if x = -2 and y = 1. (C) can never be true, as x^3 must be negative, and y^2 must be positive. (D) can never be true, since if x < 0, -x is the same thing as |x|, and |x| > y. (E) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by -1, which gives us \u2013x > y. Remember that x < 0, so \u2013x = |x|, and y is positive, so |y| = y. Thus \u2013x^3 > y^2 is the same statement as |x^3| > |y^2|, and (B) must be true.", "correct": "B"}
