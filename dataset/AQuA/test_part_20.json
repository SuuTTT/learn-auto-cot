{"question": "You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300\ncents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.", "options": ["A)500", "B)600", "C)750", "D)800", "E)900"], "rationale": "The cost of adding one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents. We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars. We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents, so to that purchase, we'd need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items. So, we take the initial 300 + (4 * 150) = 300+600 = 900.\nAnswer - E.", "correct": "E"}
{"question": "A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing.

Means to produce 7200 pens they must have to produce 8000 pens as 10% are defectives. So, let K be the manufacturing price of each pen.\nTotal income (including 25% profit) = 8000 *K *1.25\nThis same income is obtained by selling 90% manufactured pens at Rs. 10 which is equal to 7200 *10.\nThus,\n8000 *K *1.25 = 7200 *10\nK = Rs. 7.2.
