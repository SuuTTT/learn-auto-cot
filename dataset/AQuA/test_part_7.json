{"question": "Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)", "options": ["A)3", "B)4", "C)5", "D)10", "E)20"], "rationale": "The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).\nAt this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 \u2013 n) without a calculator.\nLooking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 \u2013 n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)\nAs a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.\nPlug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D", "correct": "D"}
