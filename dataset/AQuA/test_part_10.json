{"question": "Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes.

If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.\nThe two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence\nT = 13 X = 7 Y\nHence 13 X = 7 Y\nSolve the above for X\nX = 7 Y / 13\nWe want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence\nX = 7 (13) / 13 = 7\nTime T is given by\nT = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes\ncorrect answer A", "correct": "A"}
